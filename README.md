# DoATask

The DoATask project is a website for a local community, where the goal is to collaboratively perform tasks for other people, and in exchange receive ranking points and coins that can be exchanged for various rewards.

Users can:

● Post tasks that need help, ranging from assisting elderly neighbors with shopping to organizing local cleaning events;

● Browse and accept available tasks in their area;

● Earn points and coins upon completing tasks—depending on the difficulty, required time, or necessary skills, the rewards (points and coins) will vary;

● Climb the rankings based on their contribution to the community;

● Exchange the earned coins for rewards such as freebies (t-shirts, caps, etc.), tickets to community events, among other things.

To enhance transparency and trust, an evaluation system allows both the task requesters and the volunteers to receive feedback after each completed task. This helps maintain the quality of the service and encourages positive behavior within the community.
