##### @hookform/resolvers

This function allows you to use any external validation library such as Yup, Zod, Joi, Vest, Ajv and many others. The goal is to make sure you can seamlessly integrate whichever validation library you prefer. If you're not using a library, you can always write your own logic to validate your forms.
